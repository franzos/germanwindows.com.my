<p>Knowing when to replace your home's windows isn't always as clear as it may seem. If your home is older than 15 years, it's probably a good time to check and make sure your windows are still operating correctly. For instance, do you have trouble opening or closing your windows? Do you consistently find moisture on your windows' interior? Just like your washing machine, refrigerator, or roof shingles, over time, your windows and doors need to be replaced. To help you through the replacement process, German Windows provides the following tips and solutions to help determine if the time to replace -- and upgrade -- is now.</p>

  <h2>Does it seem especially noisy in your house?</h2>

  <p>Many older homes still use their original windows built with single-pane glass. Simply put, single-pane glass with windows is not energy efficient. These old windows feel hot to the touch. German Windows introduced dual-pane glass in 1952, setting a new standard for energy efficiency in windows. Today, German Windows continues to lead the industry in pioneering advances in energy efficiency to improve the comfort of your home, while saving you money on your energy bills.</p>

  <h2>Do your windows leak water or let too much air in?</h2>

  <p>The weather conditions outside your home should not appear on the inside—a good sign that your windows need to be replaced. Inefficient windows can leak, allowing water to come into your house both in front of and behind the walls—a leading cause of mold and mildew in homes. Old, worn-out windows or patio doors often leak air, resulting in high energy bills during peak cooling months. The glass may be loose or the seal between the sash and frame may have weakened. German Windows recommends replacing old single-pane windows with new windows that feature dual-pane low-E glass for substantial energy savings. You’ll see the cost for replacing failing windows is often diminished by overall household energy cost savings. Remember: if the weather outside is coming inside, you’ve got a problem.</p>

    <h2>Do your windows close and lock properly?</h2>

    <p>Besides being an important safety concern, air escapes through windows and patio doors left opened or even just unlocked. Escaping air greatly reduces the energy efficiency of your home, and replacing your windows helps to eliminate this problem.</p>
