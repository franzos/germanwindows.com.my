	<h2 style="margin-top:0px;">Strong 50 mm MULTI-CHAMBER Aluminium profile</h2>

	<p><strong>PROFILE</strong> is intensification<br>
	<strong>POSSIBLE</strong> to design and build large elements<br>
	<strong>CAN</strong> cater heavy and thicker glass <br>
	<strong>EVEN</strong> able to incorporate soundproof, security or bullet proofed glass<br>
	<strong>IN</strong> compare to uPVC material profile aluminium doesn't change the static in long duration based on UV- wave’s impact related chemical processes</p>

	<h2>EPDM Gaskets (synthetic rubber)</h2>
	<p><strong>NO</strong> silicone use to seal up the window<br>
	<strong>NO</strong> age- hardening of the material<br>
	<strong>OUTSTANDING</strong> heat, ozone and weather resistance<br>
	<strong>UV stability</strong> and permanent elastic<br>
	<strong>PERMANENT</strong> water and wind tight</p>

	<h2>UV resistance powder coated surface</h2>
	<p><strong>NO</strong> discoloring and corrosions</p>

	<h2>German made hardware</h2>
	<p><strong>HIGH</strong> grade engineered<br>
	<strong>CERTIFICATED</strong> in according European standards<br>
	<strong>PROVEN</strong> raw material quality<br>
	<strong>TIGHT</strong> multi-locking to avoid water and wind leakages<br>
	<strong>BURGLARY</strong> proofed</p>

	<h2>Glazing</h2>
	<p><strong>INSTALLED</strong> glazing doesn't touch aluminium frame or sash<br>
	<strong>BUFFER</strong> in between glazing and aluminium filled by flexible glazing blocks<br>
	<strong>AVOID</strong> glazing breakages based on differed head expansion in between aluminium and glass under sunlight</p>

	<h2>Corner joint</h2>
	<p><strong>EVERY</strong> corner stabilized by full material aluminium angles<br>
	<strong>GERMAN</strong> made two layer of polyethylene (PU) glue injected for water tightening and permanent fastening

	<h2>Incorporated SOUND & THERMAL BREAK UNIT (STBU)</h2>
	<p><strong>Aluminum</strong> is a very good heat transmitter<br>
	<strong>UNDER</strong> sunlight transfer the heat (like an oven) direct into the room<br>
	<strong>FIBER</strong> glass made STBU stop heat conduction <br>
	<strong>ENERGY</strong> saving based on air-condition consumptions up to 70%</p>

	<h2>Technology 20 years ahead the market</h2>
	<p><strong>WINDOW</strong> can be upgradable with glazing and fitting specification’s to match the renew
	living environments and demands</p>
