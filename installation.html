    <p>To utilise the full functionality of sound and energy proof windows, the connection to the building structure has to be made as <b>airtight</b> as possible. The RAL Gütegemeinschaft Fenster und Türen e. V. Germany (Quality Assurance Association for Windows and Doors) addressed this issue in detail and published the guideline on the planning and installation of windows and front doors. This guideline is considered the valid reference work for Q- Windows’s installer.</p>
    <p>Q- Windows RAL installation <b>prevents water penetration into the wall and therefore the occurrence of condensation</b>, which affect the windows’ insulating abilities.</p>
    <p>Highly durable Swiss made screw for the window direct through the building. In Germany produced joint sealing tape is used as a sealing material to fix up the space between the frame and the wall, functioning as an <b>excellent thermal and <a href="/soundproofing/">sound insulator</a></b>.</p>
