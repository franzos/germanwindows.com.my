	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
	  <p>Aluminium windows are widely recognised for being a low maintenance, functional and highly durable alternative to other more traditional building materials. Available in a variety of stylish options, in both colors and designs, this economically viable and highly flexible solution represents the next generation of functional and aesthetically pleasing window and door frames. Blending high grade European hardware and technology with the latest in hollow heat-isolation glass, Q-Aluminium windows deliver the finest construction standards available today.</p>

	  <h3>Noise Insulation</h3>
	  <p>To achieve a very high sound insulation factor, only fixed, casement (window) and turn (door) elements are possible. Sliding doors do not isolate noise as well. However, standard sound insulation can also be achieved with sliding and lift & slide elements.</p>

	  <h3>Heat Insulation</h3>
	  <p>Other then sound insulation, it's a basic requirement for heat insulation to use double glazing. The layer of air between the glass, is the key property to enable energy savings.</p>
	  <p>Characteristics: Double glazing such as 5 mm + 12A + 5 mm</p>
