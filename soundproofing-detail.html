<p><strong>What can noise do?</strong> Noise stress is a major cause of illness. It not only damages one’s hearing, it also leaves persistent marks on the human psyche. For many years, effective protection against undesired noise has not merely been a matter of comfort, but a decisive issue in health protection.</p>
<p><strong>How does sound travel?</strong> Sound travels through the air like the ripple you see on the surface of water when a stone is dropped into it. The sound waves radiate out in all directions from the source, steadily reducing in intensity or until an object stops their progress.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A proper sound insulation can only be achieved when all components play well together. The final sound insulation factor depends on the weakest element. Therefore it's important to take all factors such as glass, profile and installation into consideration.</p>

<div class="row">

	<div class="col-sm-4">
    <h3>Glass</h3><p>The glass plays an important role. Even though it's the largest element of the window, it's often overlooked. For a proper sound insulation a 10 mm or better glass is required.</p>

	<div class="col-sm-4">
    <h3>Profile</h3><p>The profile does not only help hold the glass in place but also seals the gap between glass and window opening. It’s therefore important to choose the proper sound insulating profile.</p>

<p>At Q-Windows we recognise the challenge to overcome noise pollution. Your window is customised to your specific requirements and the environment you live in - for a maximum benefit. Note: Currently there is no sound proof sliding window profile available worldwide. Therefore Q-Windows doesn't offer sliding windows. Our R&D department works hard to develop a solution.</p>

    <img class="imagesolution" src="/assets/images/sound-insulation-glass.png" alt="sound-insulation-glass"><h3>Q- Glass</h3><p>We offer a large number of different types of glasses. Our standard glazing is 6.38 mm laminated. This glas provides 32 dB of sound reduction in combination with a Q-Windows noise broken window profile. We offer a large number of different types of glasses. Sound reducing glasses, start at 12 mm, and increase in thickness based on the insulation factor required.</p>

Even the smallest gap will enable noise to enter the room. Therefore a proper sealing is of upmost importance.</p>

<h2>Elements & Aluminum Profile</h2>

<h3>Possible Configuration</h3>

<p>To achieve strong noise insulation, the elements have to be sealed especially well. This is only possible with fix and casement windows as well as doors.</p>

<h3>Aluminum Profile</h3>

<p>Aluminum profiles are ideal to achieve high sound and heat insulation performance. They also offer additional security and have a long life span. To find out more about our aluminum profile, visit the <a href="/aluminum-profile/">aluminum page</a>.

<h2>Noise source and elimination</h2>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-sm-6">
    <h3>Recommendation</h3>
    <p>
      <i class="icon-ok"></i> Bedroom <strong>30 - 35 dB</strong>
      <br><i class="icon-ok"></i> Study room <strong>35 - 40 dB</strong>
      <br><i class="icon-ok"></i> Living room <strong>40 - 45 dB</strong>
      <br><i class="icon-ok"></i> Home office	<strong>45 - 50 dB</strong>
    </p>

    <p>By subtracting the recommended indoor noise level from the typical outdoor noise level, you can estimate the appropriate acoustic performance for your windows.</p>

    	<h3>Sample calculation:</h3>

    	<p>
        1. External noise source: <strong>69 dB</strong>
        <br>2. Desired room noise level: <strong>35 dB</strong>
        <br>= The difference is <strong>34 dB</strong>
        <br>
      	<br>In this case, a 34 dB rating is required for the window and door system.

  <p>The above data is based on testing done by laboratories and internally as well as data published by glazing suppliers. It serves as a guide only. The <strong>sound reduction is only as strong as the weakest building element</strong>. It is necessary to check the sound reduction values of windows, wall and roofing as a whole.</p>

  <p>For projects that require fully tested & certified performance data, please get in touch with our specialist. We will work out a solution that suits your needs</p>

<h3>Noise source and elimination</h3>

<p> The decibel is not a linear measurement; rather it uses a logarithmic scale that accommodates the range of sound pressure levels discernible by the ear. Even the smallest decibel level deviation delivers significant results.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p> Only the combination of the right window type, glazing, profile and installation method will provide you the desired noise reduction!</p>

<p> The weight of soundproof glazing can easily reach up to 50 kg / m2. Base on this massive weight, the window design and construction, must be extraordinary strong. An air gap of only 1% of the total window can reduce the sound insulation by up to 10 dB, meaning that the noise passing through sounds twice as loud as it would if well sealed. Therefore we recommend using EPDM made gaskets in at least two levels inside window sash and window frame. Gaskets corners should welded or glued to each other to provide a permanent gap free solution.</p>
