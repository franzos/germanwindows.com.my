    <p><strong>Anti-Bandit Glass (smash and grab resistance):</strong> Anti-Bandit Glass is a laminated glass made up of two annealed glass sheets bonded together by 1.5mm thick plastic interlayer, and is tested to BS 5544. It is a security glass designed to resist manual attack and to delay access to a protected space for a short period of time. The increased effort and time required to develop an opening in the laminate serves to dissuade and thwart would-be intruders or burglars. It is ideal in situations where the noise generated by the attack alerts neighbours or inhabitants.</p>

    <p><strong>Bay Window:</strong> Windows that project out from the wall and extend to the ground. An Angle Bay Window refers to the angle departure from the plane of the wall. Window consisting of three or more units that angle out beyond the wall; often configured with a large center unit and two flanking units. <a href="http://q-windows.com.my/type/entry/bay-view">Bay View Window detail</a></p>
    <p><strong>Bullet Resistant:</strong> SUPER-SAFELITE BR (Bullet Resistant) glass is a laminated glass made in a multi-laminate process, which laminates various thicknesses of glass to meet various weapons ballistics tests. Bullet Resistant glass is ideal for windows in security areas of banks or cash handling offices. Bullet resistant laminated glass can be supplied with either a PVB or CIP interlayer.
    <br>Q- Windows manufactures a range of bullet resistant laminates suitable for a variety of weapon classes. The make-ups are classified into AS/NZS 2343, BS 5051 and German Standard DIN 5229 classes of resistance.</p>
    <p><strong>Blast Resistant:</strong> SUPER-SAFELITE EBR (Explosive Blast Resistant) glass is capable of withstanding the blast impact from explosives and can be designed and manufactured to suit each individual project. The glass is normally a multi-laminate, the thickness of which is determined by the required blast resistance. EBR glass, when glazed, is visually similar to ordinary glass. It is designed to protect against terrorist attack or explosive forces from industrial accidents.</p>

    <p><strong>Laminated Glass:</strong> is a type of safety glass that holds together when shattered. In the event of breaking, it is held in place by an interlayer, typically of polyvinyl butyral (PVB), between its two or more layers of glass. The interlayer keeps the layers of glass bonded even when broken, and its high strength prevents the glass from breaking up into large sharp pieces. The PVB interlayer also gives the glass a much higher sound insulation rating, due to the damping effect, and also blocks 99% of incoming UV radiation.</p>

    <p><strong>Protection against Vandalism:</strong> Damage caused by vandalism can be minimised by the use of laminated glass, which ensures that any broken shards of glass adhere to the interlayer and acts as a deterrent to burglars by slowing them down and attracting attention. The amount of protection is dependent on the glass and interlayer type and thickness. Standard 6.38mm laminated glass will provide minimum protection and 10.38mm will provide greater protection.</p>
    <p><strong>Perceived Sound Reduction (PSR):</strong> The percentage by which the human ear detects a lessening in sound pressure or noise is known as the Perceived Sound Reduction. A 10dB reduction in sound pressure level is generally perceived as a halving of the original noise. Sound reduction values are ‘weighted’ and used to calculate the perceived sound reduction as a ratio relative to the Rw for 3mm clear float.
    <br>The dB difference in the Rw value for a glass type when compared to 3mm float is calculated as a perceived sound reduction percentage.</p>

    <p><strong>Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC):</strong> The measure of the total solar energy transmittance entering a building through the glazing as heat gain. It is the total heat transmission of direct solar transmission and that proportion of absorbed radiation that is re-radiated into the building from the action of heat absorbing glass.

It is derived from the average of the measured transmission loss at eighteen 1/3 octave frequency bands between 100Hz and 5000Hz, or 16 bands from 125 to 4000Hz. The average STL is measured in decibels (dB), the higher the average STL figure, the more effective the glazing will be in reducing sound transmission.</p>
