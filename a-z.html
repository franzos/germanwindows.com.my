    <p>
      Anti-Bandit Glass is a laminated glass made up of two annealed glass
      sheets bonded together by 1.5mm thick plastic interlayer, and is tested to
      BS 5544. It is a security glass designed to resist manual attack and to
      delay access to a protected space for a short period of time. The
      increased effort and time required to develop an opening in the laminate
      serves to dissuade and thwart would-be intruders or burglars. It is ideal
      in situations where the noise generated by the attack alerts neighbours or
      inhabitants.

    </p>
    <h3>Bullet Resistant</h3>
    <p>
      SUPER-SAFELITE BR (Bullet Resistant) glass is a laminated glass made in a
      multi-laminate process, which laminates various thicknesses of glass to
      meet various weapons ballistics tests. Bullet Resistant glass is ideal for
      windows in security areas of banks or cash handling offices. Bullet
      resistant laminated glass can be supplied with either a PVB or CIP
      interlayer. <br />German Windows manufactures a range of bullet resistant
      laminates suitable for a variety of weapon classes. The make-ups are
      classified into AS/NZS 2343, BS 5051 and German Standard DIN 5229 classes
      of resistance.
    </p>
    <h3>Blast Resistant</h3>
    <p>
      SUPER-SAFELITE EBR (Explosive Blast Resistant) glass is capable of
      withstanding the blast impact from explosives and can be designed and
      manufactured to suit each individual project. The glass is normally a
      multi-laminate, the thickness of which is determined by the required blast
      resistance. EBR glass, when glazed, is visually similar to ordinary glass.
      It is designed to protect against terrorist attack or explosive forces
      from industrial accidents.

    <h3>Condensation</h3>
    <p>
      The deposit of water vapor from the air on any cold surface whose
      temperature is below the dew point, such as a window glass or frame that
      is exposed to cold outdoor air. See Dew Point Temperature.
    </p>
    <h3>Coolness Factor (CF)</h3>
    <p>
      The Coolness Factor (or luminous efficacy) is the visible light
      transmission divided by the shading coefficient. CF = VLT / SC. It is a
      useful means of comparing different glass types in terms of the trade-off
      between light transmission and heat control in selecting glass. Glass
      types with a coolness factor of 1 transmit as much light as heat, those
      with a coolness factor lower than 1 transmit more heat than light and
      those with a coolness factor greater than 1 transmit more light than heat.

  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="tabL">
    <h3>Laminated Glass</h3>
    <p>
      is a type of safety glass that holds together when shattered. In the event
      of breaking, it is held in place by an interlayer, typically of polyvinyl
      butyral (PVB), between its two or more layers of glass. The interlayer
      keeps the layers of glass bonded even when broken, and its high strength
      prevents the glass from breaking up into large sharp pieces. The PVB
      interlayer also gives the glass a much higher sound insulation rating, due
      to the damping effect, and also blocks 99% of incoming UV radiation.
    </p>
    <h3>Latch</h3>

    <h3>Protection against Vandalism</h3>
    <p>
      Damage caused by vandalism can be minimised by the use of laminated glass,
      which ensures that any broken shards of glass adhere to the interlayer and
      acts as a deterrent to burglars by slowing them down and attracting
      attention. The amount of protection is dependent on the glass and
      interlayer type and thickness. Standard 6.38mm laminated glass will
      provide minimum protection and 10.38mm will provide greater protection.
    </p>
    <h3>Perceived Sound Reduction (PSR)</h3>
    <p>
      The percentage by which the human ear detects a lessening in sound
      pressure or noise is known as the Perceived Sound Reduction. A 10dB
      reduction in sound pressure level is generally perceived as a halving of
      the original noise. Sound reduction values are ‘weighted’ and used to
      calculate the perceived sound reduction as a ratio relative to the Rw for
      3mm clear float. <br />The dB difference in the Rw value for a glass type
      when compared to 3mm float is calculated as a perceived sound reduction
      percentage.

    <h3>Sash</h3>
    <p>A framework that holds the panes of a window in the window frame</p>
    <h3>Sealant</h3>
    <p>
      A compressible PDM material used to seal any opening or junction of two
      parts, such as between the glass and a metal sash.
    </p>
    <h3>Shading Coefficient</h3>
    <p>
      The ratio of the total solar heat gain through a particular glass compared
      to the total solar heat gain through 3mm clear float glass. (86%) The
      shading coefficient of 3mm clear float is by definition 1.0 and represents
      a base glass performance. The lower the shading coefficient the less heat
      gain and thus more shading is provided by the glass. The shading
      coefficient is calculated as SC = SHGC / 0.86.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)</h3>
    <p>
      The measure of the total solar energy transmittance entering a building
      through the glazing as heat gain. It is the total heat transmission of
      direct solar transmission and that proportion of absorbed radiation that
      is re-radiated into the building from the action of heat absorbing glass.
      The lower the SHGC the better the glass restricts heat energy
      transmission. The SHGC is also known as the Solar Factor (SF).
    </p>
    <h3>Sound Transmission Class (STC)</h3>
    <p>
      Rating system used to measure how much sound is transferred through
      windows/doors (see also OITC)
    </p>
    <h3>Sound Transmission Loss (STL)</h3>
    <p>
      The average Sound Transmission Loss is useful for determining the
      effectiveness of glazed panels to isolate exterior noise (such as traffic)
      from a building. It is derived from the average of the measured
      transmission loss at eighteen 1/3 octave frequency bands between 100Hz and
      5000Hz, or 16 bands from 125 to 4000Hz. The average STL is measured in
      decibels (dB), the higher the average STL figure, the more effective the
      glazing will be in reducing sound transmission.

    <p>
      The U Value is the measure of air to air heat transfer through glass due
      to the thermal conductance of the glazing and the difference between
      indoor and outdoor temperatures. It is expressed as W/m2K (Watts per m2
      per 1° Kelvin) or W/ m2 °C (1 Kelvin equals 1°C). The U value is a measure
      of the rate of heat gain or heat loss through the glazing due to
