When you start with something ordinary and make it extraordinary, magic happens. That’s why, when it’s time to remodel, so many people trust their vision to Q-Windows. For over a century, we’ve set the standard for what window could do for a home. Then we set out to raise that standard even higher. You can see it in the way our products look, the way they perform and the way they’ve transformed homes all across Malaysia from ordinary to extraordinary.

**A room with a view**

Windows can help make the most of every room in your new house, and Q-Windows is here to help every step of the way. We’ll show you how and why choosing Q-Windows windows and doors for your new home can be one of the easiest decisions of the entire building process.

Even in the planning stages, it’s hard not to think about the resale value you’re building into your property. We all know there are many factors that go into that equation, but few, if any, give the immediate impact of windows. Windows not only bring light and beauty into your home, they add character and expression to the outside as well. Take advantage of unusual shapes and dramatic combinations to set your home off from the others on the block—or the rest of the world.
