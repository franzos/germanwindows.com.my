callout: "While an energy efficient air-condition is great, the most saving will come from windows and doors that are optimised to reduce the heat transfer between the humid, hot, tropical outside and the cool, comfortable inside of your property. Let's have a look at the 2 most important factors: Glass and Profile."

<h2>Q-Windows energy saving features</h2>
<h3>Double glazing</h3>

<p>The glass is by far the largest element of any window, hence the choice of glass has a substantial impact on whether your window is energy saving and, how much energy you’re going to save. The choice of glass depends first and foremost on your requirements but has to be matched to the profile.</p>

<h3>Thermal break profile</h3>

<p>As the second largest element of a window, the window profiles plays an important role in noise and heat reduction. Unlike traditional aluminium profiles, Q-Windows aluminium profiles feature a thermal break and a depth of at least 50mm. The thermal break helps minimize heat transfer and maximize your energy savings.</p>

<h2>Calculate your savings</h2>
<p>The average 24,000 BTU household air conditioner in the Malaysia consumes 1,800 kWh of electricity annually. That translates to 150 kWh per month. That costs 602 MYR per year at the national average electricity rate of 0.334 MYR per kWh, or 50 MYR per month.</p>

<h4>Example calculation</h4>
<p>Your current bill: 602 MYR / year
<br>
<br>Average savings: 47% (282.94 MYR / year)
<br>over 10 years: 2829.4 MYR
<br>over 20 years: 5649,8 MYR</p>

<p>If you're using multiple or larger air conditioner units, savings increase.</p>
