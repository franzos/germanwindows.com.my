<h2>Window and Door Warranty</h2>

<p>Obtain warranty documents or register your product below.</p>

<p>
  German Windows and doors are covered by our exclusive life long Warranty. Most
  other window warranties end when a home is sold, but our Life long coverage -
  is completely transferable from each owner to the next during the first 10
  years after we installed the elements.
</p>

<p>
  And, because it is not prorated, the coverage offers full benefits, year after
  year, owner after owner, so it can add real value when you decide to sell your
  home.
</p>

<h3>Warranty Registration</h3>
