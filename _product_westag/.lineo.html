<h2>Minimalist design with maximum ambience</h2>

<p>The most striking aspect of the Lineo door series is its minimalist design and cool look. This restrained approach makes them incredibly versatile. The sophisticated, integrated details offer that certain “je ne sais quoi”. They draw the eye and play a huge role in establishing a classy ambience.</p>

<h3>Striking colours and subtle details with a stainless steel look</h3>

<p>The powerful impression made by doors in our Lineo design series is the result of combining imposing elements with more delicate details. Powerful colours form the basis for the design, and are offset by the slender strip inserts with stainless steel look. The strip inserts are inset perfectly into the door leaf with a slight protrusion – this gives the Lineo doors their unique character and will lend your living space an ultra-modern look.</p>

<h3>A versatile series to match any style</h3>

<p>Living space or office – the doors in our elegant Lineo design series will ooze style wherever you install them, and at any time of day. Their special design combines a sleek, modern look with creative nuances to make an overwhelmingly impressive whole. Lineo doors are available with horizontal or vertical strip inserts. Selected models also come with a built-in strip aperture in a choice of glass materials for that extra touch of class.</p>

<h3>Lineo doors work perfectly in any room</h3>

<p>The design of the Lineo doors is minimalist, yet also charming and attractive, making them perfectly compatible with absolutely any room. They are the ideal match for a cosy living room, but also work just as well in a functional home office. This enormous versatility is one of the greatest strengths of Westag & Getalit’s top-class Lineo design series.</p>
