<h2>Almost invisible, yet so beautiful</h2>

<h3>‘40/80’ sliding door system (running in front of the wall)</h3>

<p>These sliding doors are either screwed directly onto the wall or combined with a standard passageway frame. They are equipped on both sides with circular shell handles. If you are looking for a lockable model or a lavatory door, we recommend opting for the version with a circular deadbolt and posts. Sliding doors running in front of the wall can also be retrofitted to an already existing Westag & Getalit frame.</p>

<h3>Sliding door systems running inside the wall</h3>

<h4>Great entrance – discreet departure</h4>

Sleeping and dressing, cooking and eating, living and working. Sliding doors running inside the wall are not only space savers but also a sophisticated way of linking different living areas. One gentle hand movement – and its time for your door’s great entrance. A second touch and it disappears silently in the wall. Lovers of aesthetic living value the space gained. Because furniture, pictures, lamps and accessories can be placed directly against the wall.
