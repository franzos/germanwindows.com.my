<h2>Safe and sound - Day and night</h2>
<p>
  Everyone wants to feel comfortable at home. This is where doors come in: they
  play an important role in our lives, giving us that all-important sense of
  safety and security, protecting us and keeping out noise and unwelcome guests.
  At German Windows you can put together your own individual doors with the
  exact technical features you need. The result: interior doors and apartment
  entrance doors that are tailored to your requirements and have the functions
  and the technology that suit you and your lifestyle.
</p>

<h2>Basic protection for peace of mind</h2>
<p>
  <b
    >A simple feeling of security – the basic model for those with high
    standards</b
  >
</p>

<p>
  Even our standard version has plenty of features. At German Windows, that’s a
  matter of course, because we believe that secure doors don’t have to come at a
  high price. Our apartment entrance doors meet strict environmental
  requirements and withstand tough conditions as standard. An important detail:
  all doors from German Windows bear the RAL quality mark, which certifies that
  a product has been manufactured in compliance with strict, standardised
  quality criteria. The recommendations for use in accordance with RAL GZ 426
  ensure that you’re always on the safe side when realising your construction
  project.

<h2>It's better to be safe than sorry</h2>
<p>

</p>

<p>
  Welcome to the quiet zone. Doors with soundproofing ensure that noise stays
  where it belongs – outside. Even our standard apartment entrance doors meet
  all soundproofing and safety requirements in accordance with DIN 4109. This
  means you get three features in one: soundproofing, security and load-bearing
  capacity.
</p>

<p>
  German Windows re-rated doors provide a high level of protection against re.
  Like all the interior and apartment entrance doors in our range, they look
  good and have great technical features. In addition to re-rated doors, we also
  offer combined versions for additional smoke protection requirements and pure
  smoke protection doors.

<h2>Making life difficult for burglars</h2>
<p>
  <b
    >Apartment entrance doors with protection against intrusion and burglary
    (optional)</b

</p>

<p>
  A burglary is committed somewhere in Malaysia every two minutes. Many burglars
  break in during the day, often via the entrance door. With the right security
  equipment, 40 per cent of break-ins can be prevented. German Windows doors
  protect you from uninvited guests and make your home a safe haven.
